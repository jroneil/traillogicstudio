# Trail Logic Studio Notion Pack

This pack provides lightweight SVG assets sized for Notion page covers and icons. All artwork uses Trail Logic Studio brand colors (`#1F3325`, `#2F4F3A`, `#C5A45A`, `#FAFAF8`) and avoids embedded text for clean layering behind Notion titles.

## Covers (1500x600)
- **trail-logic-cover.svg** — General brand landscape with layered ridgelines and topo traces.
- **white-mountains-cover.svg** — Granite-forward peaks with snow caps inspired by the Whites.
- **adirondacks-cover.svg** — Rolling green silhouettes and warm shoreline shapes for Adirondack trips.
- **canoe-trips-cover.svg** — Calm waterlines with a minimalist canoe silhouette and ripples.
- **winter-trips-cover.svg** — Snow-dusted ridges and soft snowfall dots for cold-weather planning.

Use these as Notion page covers for product hubs, trip collections, or featured journeys. Each file keeps a 1500x600 viewBox and rounded frame so they scale nicely when uploaded.

## Icons (512x512)
- **icon-trail-logic.svg** — Core brand compass mark.
- **icon-backpacking.svg** — Pack graphic for trekking logs or gear lists.
- **icon-canoe.svg** — Canoe and paddle motif for paddle trips or portage notes.
- **icon-winter.svg** — Snowflake badge for winter routes and cold-weather checklists.
- **icon-planner.svg** — Checklist card for planning dashboards or sprints.
- **icon-freebies.svg** — Gift box emblem for downloads, templates, and bonuses.

Upload these as Notion page icons; they sit centered on light backgrounds and stay crisp at small sizes.

## How to use in Notion
1. Open the page where you want a custom cover or icon.
2. For a **cover**, click *Change cover* → *Upload* and pick one of the `*-cover.svg` files.
3. For an **icon**, click the page icon → *Upload* and select any `icon-*.svg` file.
4. Notion will scale the vectors automatically. If the preview looks cached, refresh the page once after upload.

All assets live in `/public/notion-pack/` and can be dragged from your file explorer directly into Notion.
