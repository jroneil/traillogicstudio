# Trail Logic Studio Brand Guidelines

These guidelines keep the Trail Logic Studio identity consistent across every touchpoint. Use them as a quick reference for press, partners, and internal teams.

## Logo usage
- Use **logo-dark.svg** on light or neutral backgrounds. Use **logo-light.svg** on dark or photography-heavy backgrounds.
- Maintain clear space equal to the height of the letter **T** on all sides of the logo. Do not crop or distort.
- Minimum sizes: 220px wide for digital; 1.5in wide for print-equivalent exports.
- The **icon-mark.svg** may be used alone for favicons, avatars, or small badges.

## Color palette
- Primary: **Deep Trail** `#1A2A6C` and **Summit Mint** `#1DC1B0`
- Accent: **Signal Ember** `#F24F13`
- Neutrals: **Ridgeline Slate** `#1F2933`, **Trail Sand** `#F2E9DA`
- Favor high contrast pairings: Deep Trail on Trail Sand, or Summit Mint on Deep Trail.

## Typography and tone
- Preferred font: Inter or any clean, geometric sans-serif with strong legibility.
- Tone: confident, curious, and clear. Use active verbs and avoid jargon.
- Keep headlines concise and lead with outcomes or benefits.

## Spacing and layout
- Use an 8px spacing grid. Align elements to consistent vertical rhythms.
- Rounded corners should mirror the logo radius (8–16px depending on size).
- When placing the logo over imagery, add a 20–40% overlay to ensure contrast.

## Imagery
- Favor landscapes, maps, and subtle gradients that imply direction or elevation.
- Avoid overcrowded visuals or abstract textures that compete with the logo.

## Do and don't
- **Do:** Provide ample breathing room, respect color contrast, and keep alignment tidy.
- **Don't:** Stretch, rotate, or recolor the logo outside the palette; avoid drop shadows that reduce clarity.
