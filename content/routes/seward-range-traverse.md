# Seward Range Traverse

## Overview
Remote Adirondack High Peaks outing linking Seward, Donaldson, and Emmons with an optional Calkins Brook loop for solitude and soft footing.

## Distance + Gain (Approx)
17 miles, ~4,500 feet gain.

## Difficulty
Strenuous due to remoteness, unmaintained herd paths, and muddy conditions.

## Itinerary Suggestions
- Ascend via Calkins Brook herd path for a gentler climb to Donaldson.
- Continue to Emmons and backtrack to Seward, then descend via the Ward Brook herd path.
- Plan for a full-day effort with early start from Coreys Road.

## Tips
- GPS track helps on herd path junctions.
- Expect wet feet—wear quick-drying footwear.
- Bear canisters required if camping near trailheads.

## Warnings
- Mud and blowdown can slow progress significantly.
- Limited cell service; inform a contact of your plan.

## Bailouts
- After Donaldson, you can descend Calkins Brook if weather deteriorates.
- Ward Brook lean-to area offers camping if you run out of daylight.

## Weather Considerations
- Trails hold water after storms; check for high water at brook crossings.
- Mosquitoes and blackflies intense in early summer—pack head net and repellent.
