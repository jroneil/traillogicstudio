# Long Trail: Lincoln Gap to Appalachian Gap

## Overview
Classic spine-of-the-Green Mountains section across Mount Abraham, Lincoln Peak, and Mount Ellen with ridge walking and ski area views.

## Distance + Gain (Approx)
11 miles, ~2,900 feet gain.

## Difficulty
Moderate-strenuous day hike with steady climbs and occasional scrambles.

## Itinerary Suggestions
- Spot a car at Appalachian Gap and start from Lincoln Gap heading north.
- Enjoy views from Mount Abraham early, then traverse ski infrastructure near Sugarbush and Mad River Glen.
- Finish with a steep descent to Appalachian Gap.

## Tips
- Travel northbound to keep the longer descent at the end.
- Water sources are limited on the ridge—carry enough between peaks.
- Consider a sunset finish with headlamps for quieter trails.

## Warnings
- Slick rocks and roots after rain.
- Traffic noise near ski areas can make navigation tricky—follow blazes closely.

## Bailouts
- Ski area access roads provide potential exits to Route 17.
- Heaven's Gate and Slide Brook trails offer alternate descents if weather worsens.

## Weather Considerations
- Fog is common on the ridge; white blazes may be harder to spot.
- Winter requires traction and may have lift-served closures—check resort advisories.
