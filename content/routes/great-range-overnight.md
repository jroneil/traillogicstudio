# Great Range Overnight

## Overview
Two-day traverse of the Great Range with a night at Johns Brook Lodge or nearby campsites, easing the elevation while keeping the marquee peaks.

## Distance + Gain (Approx)
18 miles, ~7,500 feet gain.

## Difficulty
Strenuous backpack with steep terrain; more approachable than a single-day push.

## Itinerary Suggestions
- Day 1: Hike into JBL area, climb Lower and Upper Wolfjaw, and camp or stay at the lodge.
- Day 2: Continue over Armstrong, Gothics, Saddleback, Basin, and Haystack before exiting to the Garden.
- Optional sidetrip to Marcy if time and weather allow.

## Tips
- Reserve JBL or campsites early in peak season.
- Bear canisters required—pack accordingly.
- Start day two at dawn for ample time across the technical sections.

## Warnings
- Cables and ladders on Gothics and steep ledges on Saddleback demand attention.
- Water sources limited on the ridge; refill at Ore Bed Brook.

## Bailouts
- Slant Rock area provides a shorter exit via Phelps Trail if fatigue sets in.
- Ore Bed Brook Trail can cut the traverse short.

## Weather Considerations
- Thunderstorms can make the technical sections hazardous.
- Fall winds can be fierce on the exposed ridges—bring insulation.
