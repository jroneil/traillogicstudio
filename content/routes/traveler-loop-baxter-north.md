# Traveler Loop (Baxter North)

## Overview
Remote alpine-style loop over North Traveler, Peak of the Ridges, and Traveler Mountain showcasing Baxter's quieter northern peaks.

## Distance + Gain (Approx)
10.6 miles, ~3,600 feet gain.

## Difficulty
Strenuous; steep scrambles, loose rock, and remote setting demand preparation.

## Itinerary Suggestions
- Start at South Branch Pond Campground and climb clockwise to tackle the steepest grades uphill.
- Enjoy expansive views from the ridge before descending to the ponds.
- Pair with a campsite reservation at South Branch for an early start.

## Tips
- Carry extra water; limited sources on the ridge.
- Trekking poles useful for the rocky descents.
- Pack a small first-aid kit—rescue response is limited.

## Warnings
- Exposed talus can be hazardous when wet.
- Black bear activity reported—store food securely in campground facilities.

## Bailouts
- None once committed to the loop; you must complete the circuit back to South Branch Pond.

## Weather Considerations
- Northern Baxter can be windy and colder than Katahdin—layer accordingly.
- Thunderstorms can make the exposed ridge dangerous; start early to avoid afternoon buildups.
