# Great Range Day Push

## Overview
Fast-and-light traverse of the central Great Range from Rooster Comb to Mount Haystack, hitting classic ADK summits and ladders in one push.

## Distance + Gain (Approx)
20 miles, ~9,000 feet gain.

## Difficulty
Very hard; steep scrambles, ladders, and sustained elevation changes require fitness and confidence.

## Itinerary Suggestions
- Start from Rooster Comb trailhead before dawn and move efficiently to Gothics and Saddleback.
- Use the cable route on Gothics and descend the steep Saddleback ledges carefully.
- Finish over Basin and Haystack, then exit via Phelps Trail to the Garden.

## Tips
- Pack gloves for the cables and ladders.
- Water can be scarce on the ridge; refill at Ore Bed Brook.
- Consider stashing a bike at the Garden to avoid a long shuttle.

## Warnings
- Steep ledges on Saddleback are slippery when wet or icy.
- Route finding can be confusing at junctions—carry a recent map.

## Bailouts
- Ore Bed Brook Trail offers an early exit to Johns Brook Lodge.
- Shorey Shortcut can shorten the day but is still steep.

## Weather Considerations
- The range is exposed; avoid in thunderstorms.
- Spring mud season restrictions may apply—check DEC advisories.
