# High Peaks Canoe & Carry Loop

## Overview
Mixed paddle-and-carry circuit through the Adirondack High Peaks Wilderness linking Henderson Lake, Preston Ponds, and the Upper Works.

## Distance + Gain (Approx)
10 miles paddling, 3 miles carrying; minimal elevation gain.

## Difficulty
Moderate; portages require fitness but water sections are calm.

## Itinerary Suggestions
- Launch at Henderson Lake and paddle to the northern inlet.
- Carry to Upper Preston Pond, paddle across, then portage to Lower Preston Pond.
- Return via the Calamity Brook trail corridor to Upper Works.

## Tips
- Use a lightweight canoe or packraft to simplify carries.
- Pack wheels are not permitted; plan to shoulder or yoke carry.
- Bear canister required if camping; good sites near Upper Works.

## Warnings
- Water levels vary; shallow sections may require dragging.
- Bugs are intense mid-June through July—bring head net and repellent.

## Bailouts
- Shorten the loop by returning directly from Upper Preston Pond the way you came.
- Hike out on Calamity Brook Trail if winds pick up on the lakes.

## Weather Considerations
- Wind can create difficult paddling on open sections; start early.
- Cold water in spring/fall—wear appropriate thermal protection.
