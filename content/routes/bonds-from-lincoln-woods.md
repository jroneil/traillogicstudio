# Bonds from Lincoln Woods

## Overview
Out-and-back to Bondcliff, Mount Bond, and West Bond via the gentle Lincoln Woods approach for massive Pemigewasset views without a full loop.

## Distance + Gain (Approx)
19 miles, ~3,700 feet gain.

## Difficulty
Moderate-strenuous due to length; terrain is relatively forgiving once on the Bondcliff Trail.

## Itinerary Suggestions
- Bike the initial rail-grade miles to save time on the exit if allowed.
- Camp at Guyot Shelter for a relaxed overnight with a West Bond sunset.
- Day hikers should start at dawn to manage the long mileage.

## Tips
- Water is available near Guyot Shelter; carry enough for the ridge sections.
- Consider lightweight footwear for the long flat approach.
- Sunset on Bondcliff is spectacular—bring a headlamp for the return.

## Warnings
- Exposure on Bondcliff can be intimidating in wind or with snow/ice.
- The long approach can feel monotonous; manage pacing and nutrition.

## Bailouts
- None once committed beyond the Bondcliff ridge; turn back as needed.

## Weather Considerations
- Afternoon thunderstorms roll off the Franconia Range; plan summit timing accordingly.
- Fall and spring often bring ice on shaded ledges—carry traction in shoulder seasons.
