# Wolfjaws Loop

## Overview
Moderate Great Range sampler tagging Lower and Upper Wolfjaw via a loop from the Garden with classic High Peaks scenery.

## Distance + Gain (Approx)
12 miles, ~4,000 feet gain.

## Difficulty
Moderate-strenuous day hike with steep climbs and some scrambly sections.

## Itinerary Suggestions
- Ascend via Johns Brook Lodge to the Wolfjaw col and summit Lower then Upper Wolfjaw.
- Descend via the Wedge Brook Trail for a quieter exit and water access.
- Start early to secure parking at the Garden.

## Tips
- Ladders and scrambles are mild compared to higher range peaks—good intro to ADK terrain.
- Carry a bear canister if staying overnight at nearby sites.
- Pack extra socks; trails can be muddy year-round.

## Warnings
- Slippery roots and rock slabs common after rain.
- Limited cell reception in the valley.

## Bailouts
- Descend back to Johns Brook Valley from the col if weather turns.
- Skip Upper Wolfjaw to shorten the day without losing scenery.

## Weather Considerations
- Mud season can slow travel considerably; check DEC advisories.
- Winter ascents require traction and potentially snowshoes under regulations.
