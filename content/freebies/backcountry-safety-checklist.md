# Backcountry Safety Checklist

Trail Logic keeps risk simple: notice early, act early. Use this checklist before and during your trip.

## Pre-Trip Plan
- Define the goal, turnaround time, and a Plan B route.
- Share your route link, vehicle, and “call for help if no check-in by” time.
- Download offline maps and write key waypoints in a pocket notebook.

## Health and Environment
- [ ] Hydrated and fueled before driving to the trailhead.
- [ ] Altitude plan: slow day one above 8,000 ft; sleep low when possible.
- [ ] Sun, bug, and water treatment packed based on forecast.

## Communication and Emergencies
| Tool | Purpose | Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whistle | Immediate attention within earshot | Three blasts signals distress |
| Phone + battery | Primary contact and navigation | Keep warm and in airplane mode |
| Satellite messenger | Check-ins and SOS beyond service | Preload messages and contacts |
| Paper note | Leave at car | Include route, group size, return time |

## Field Checks
- Time: compare actual pace to plan every hour.
- Weather: reassess cloud build-up, wind, and temps at each break.
- Group: rotate leaders, check feet and fingers for hot spots or cold.
- Hazards: note avalanche slopes, loose rock, or river rise and adjust spacing.

## Decision Points
- Turn around if any two: bad weather, falling pace, or gut feeling of risk.
- Shorten the objective if daylight buffer drops below 60–90 minutes.
- If lost, stop moving, mark the spot, and rebuild position before acting.
