# Trip Planning Basics

Trail Logic Studio keeps planning simple so you can stay focused on the trail. Use this quick primer to build a confident day or weekend plan without overthinking it.

## Choose Your Objective
- Match distance to daylight and fitness. Aim for 2 miles/hour on mixed terrain.
- Prioritize one highlight: summit view, waterfall, or quiet forest loop.
- Set a clear turnaround time and stick to it if weather or pace slips.

## Check Conditions and Timing
- Look at the 12–24 hour forecast, then the hourly breakdown for wind, temps, and precipitation.
- Read the latest trip reports for snow, blowdowns, and water crossings.
- Build a simple time plan:
  - Approach: 40% of total time
  - Main objective: 20%
  - Exit: 30%
  - Buffer: 10% for photos, snacks, and surprises

## Map the Route
- Save the route offline on two apps or devices.
- Mark these waypoints: trailhead, water sources, bail-out routes, turnaround time, and parking pin.
- Print a small map strip with key bearings for pocket navigation.

## Pack the Essentials
| Category | Pack It | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Navigation | Map, compass, charged phone | Redundancy beats dead batteries |
| Safety | First aid kit, headlamp, whistle | Handle twists after dark |
| Comfort | Layers, hat, sun protection | Temperature swings are real |
| Fuel | 250–300 calories/hour, 0.5–0.7L water/hour | Keep the engine steady |
