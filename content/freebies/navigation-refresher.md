# Navigation Refresher

Trail Logic champions simple, confident navigation. This quick refresher keeps you oriented even when the trail fades.

## Check Your Tools
- Map scale circled and oriented to north.
- Compass declination set for your region.
- Phone in airplane mode with offline maps; battery saver on.
- Backup power: lightweight battery bank and short cable.

## Before Leaving the Trailhead
- Identify three catching features (ridge, stream, road) that frame your route.
- Note a handrail to follow: creek, ridgeline, or obvious contour.
- Set a pace estimate and schedule a 30-minute location check-in.

## Quick Bearing Drill
1. Point your body at the target feature.
2. Rotate the bezel until north lines up with the red needle.
3. Read your bearing at the direction-of-travel arrow.
4. Pick a landmark in that direction and walk to it; repeat.

## Staying Found Checklist
- [ ] Re-rail: compare terrain to contour lines every 20–30 minutes.
- [ ] Elevation check: altimeter vs. known saddle or creek confluence.
- [ ] Time check: are you ahead or behind your turnaround time?
- [ ] Weather watch: visibility drops mean tighter navigation intervals.

## If You Drift Off Line
- Stop. Take a breath and note the last confirmed point.
- Move to a strong feature (ridge crest, drainage, open knoll) for a reset.
- Shoot a back bearing toward your last known point to rejoin the line.
- If unsure, follow the handrail back to the start and reassess.
