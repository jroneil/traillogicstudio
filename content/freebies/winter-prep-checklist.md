# Winter Prep Checklist

Trail Logic loves cold-weather miles, but margin matters. Use this checklist to prep smart and stay warm.

## Conditions and Timing
- Check avalanche forecasts and recent snowpack discussions if traveling near slopes.
- Note daylight hours; plan to be back 60–90 minutes before dark.
- Overnight lows drive insulation choices—match layers to the coldest expected temp.

## Layering System
- [ ] Base: synthetic or merino, no cotton.
- [ ] Mid: active insulation (grid fleece or light puffy) that vents well on climbs.
- [ ] Shell: waterproof/breathable with pit zips if possible.
- [ ] Static warmth: belay parka kept dry in a liner bag.
- [ ] Hands and head: liner gloves, insulated mitts, windproof hat, neck gaiter.

## Traction and Travel
| Terrain | Bring | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Packed trails | Microspikes, trekking poles | Fast and light, but keep poles short |
| Icy slopes | Mountaineering traction | Pair with an ice axe and training |
| Deep snow | Snowshoes or skis | Look for float and easy bindings |

## Safety Extras
- [ ] Hot drink in a vacuum bottle for on-the-move warmth.
- [ ] Chemical warmers for hands and toes.
- [ ] Backup headlamp and batteries stay close to your body heat.
- [ ] Emergency bivy plus closed-cell sit pad to get off snow.
- [ ] If avalanche terrain: beacon, shovel, probe—and partners who practice.

## Trailhead Final Check
- Heater on while gearing up so boots start warm.
- Goggles or clear glasses packed for spindrift and wind.
- Phone battery at 90%+; cold drains fast, so keep it inside a jacket pocket.
- Text your contact: route, start time, turnaround, and “back by” time.
