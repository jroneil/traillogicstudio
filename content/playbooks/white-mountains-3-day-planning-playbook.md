# White Mountains 3-Day Planning Playbook

## Introduction
The White Mountains are a condensed classroom for trip leadership, weather interpretation, and resilient hiking systems. This playbook gives trip planners a premium-level, three-day template that balances ambition with safety. It focuses on realistic pacing, contingency thinking, and the subtle details—like trailhead parking windows and wind exposure thresholds—that separate a smooth outing from a stressful one. Use it as a repeatable process: review the phases, run the checklists, and adjust based on current conditions and group readiness.

## Planning Principles
- **Staged objectives**: Define A/B/C itineraries that can be executed without heroics. Day-by-day exit points should be obvious and communicated to all hikers.
- **Weather ceilings**: Establish numerical limits for wind (e.g., 35–40 mph on exposed ridges), precipitation type, and real-feel temperatures to determine whether to reroute or turn back.
- **Energy budgeting**: Use conservative Naismith estimations augmented by +10–20% for rough footing, wet rock, and scrambles common on Franconia Ridge and the Presidential Range.
- **Redundancy**: Two nav sources (map/compass + digital), two lighting sources per person, and a minimum of two group shelters (tarp + emergency bivy) for rapid response.

## Itinerary Architecture
1. **Day 1: Approach and Acclimation**
   - Trailhead check-in, parking payment, and initial pack shakeout.
   - Moderate elevation gain to test pacing; camp near reliable water and sheltered trees.
   - Evening weather update and overnight condensation management.
2. **Day 2: Summit and Traverse Window**
   - Early start to maximize stable weather; ridge travel if winds allow.
   - Contingency descent routes pre-loaded (e.g., Greenleaf, Falling Waters, Edmands Path).
   - Enforce turnaround times; prioritize group integrity over objectives.
3. **Day 3: Exit and Debrief**
   - Short summit tag or scenic spur if energy is high and weather is favorable.
   - Trailhead recovery plan: hydration, dry clothes, and vehicle readiness.

## Route Selection Table
| Objective Type | Example Loop | Mileage/Gain | Water Notes | Bailout Options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ridge Classic | Franconia Loop (Liberty Springs approach) | 10–12 mi / ~4,000 ft | AMC hut spigot seasonal; streams low mid-summer | Greenleaf Hut, Old Bridle Path |
| Presidential Lite | Edmands Path to Eisenhower, Pierce loop | 8–10 mi / ~3,200 ft | Intermittent seepage; carry 2–3L | Mizpah Hut, Crawford Path | 
| Waterfall Focused | Zealand Falls, Twinway spur | 9–11 mi / ~2,800 ft | Dependable falls; filter advised | Zealand Road exit | 
| Forest Basecamp | Wilderness tent site + day hikes | Varies | Near river; monitor flood risk | Straightforward retreat |

## Weather and Seasonal Readiness
- **Shoulder seasons (April–May, Oct–Nov)**: Expect freeze-thaw, hidden ice, and strong ridge winds. Microspikes and heat-management layers move from optional to mandatory. 
- **Summer**: Thunderstorms build after noon. Establish a 11:00–12:00 ridge drop-dead time when convection is forecast. Carry sun protection for open granite and alpine zones.
- **Winter**: Short daylight and heavy pack weights. Stove reliability, fuel calculations, and avalanche awareness (esp. Tuckerman/Ammo zones) become critical. Confirm current Forest Service guidance.
- **Fog and low visibility**: White-out navigation practice with bearing discipline keeps teams off cornices and out of krummholz traps.

## Gear Systems
- **Shelter**: Freestanding or semi-freestanding tents handle granite platforms; bring guylines and anchors for thin soil. Tarps need robust knots for high winds.
- **Sleep**: 15–20°F comfort-rated quilts/bags for shoulder seasons. Pair with high-R-value pads to reduce conductive loss on rock or platformed tent sites.
- **Cooking**: Canister stoves are efficient below treeline; white gas or liquid systems hedge against deep cold. Assign one stove per 3 people plus an emergency alcohol kit.
- **Navigation**: Carry updated USGS/AMC maps, a backup compass, GPX files on two devices, and printed turn sheets with bearings for low-visibility ridges.
- **Hydration**: Minimum 2–3L capacity per person. Water filters plus chlorine dioxide tablets. Track known water crossings and dry stretches.
- **Footwear**: Aggressive outsole lugs for wet rock. In shoulder seasons, pack microspikes and waterproof socks or lightweight gaiters.

## Nutrition and Fueling Strategy
- **Caloric targets**: 3,000–4,500 kcal/day depending on pack weight and cold exposure.
- **Macronutrient balance**: 45–55% carbs for steady output; 25–35% fats for dense calories; 15–20% protein for recovery.
- **Hydration**: 0.4–0.7L/hour with electrolyte replacement. Pre-hydrate before big climbs and hot days.
- **Meal timing**: Front-load breakfast, steady grazing every 45–60 minutes, and protective hot dinner to aid sleep.
- **Fuel planning table**:

| Day | Breakfast | Trail Food | Dinner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Oats + nut butter | Tortillas, cheese, jerky | Couscous + tuna | Eat early to manage ascent |
| 2 | Grits + olive oil | Bars, dried fruit, gummies | Rice + dehydrated veggies + miso | Target ridge start before 07:00 |
| 3 | Granola + powdered milk | Nuts, cookies, electrolytes | Town meal post-hike | Keep snacks accessible for exit push |

## Safety and Risk Controls
- **Group roles**: Assign navigator, pace-setter, gear lead, and medic. Rotate roles to manage fatigue.
- **Decision gates**: Pre-select objective go/no-go criteria: winds over 40 mph on exposed ridges, sustained freezing rain, lightning risk, or time overruns of 25% at interim checkpoints.
- **Communication**: Leave trip plan with a trusted contact. Carry satellite messenger with interval check-ins. Preload local emergency numbers.
- **Incident response**: Establish simple protocols—halt, assess, shelter, signal. Practice splinting, hypothermia wraps, and stove accident response.
- **Environmental care**: Use existing tent platforms, avoid trampling alpine zones, and follow bear precautions for food storage.

## Checklists
### Pre-Trip Logistics
- Confirm parking reservations or cash for fee stations.
- Print paper maps and mark bailout bearings.
- Share itinerary with emergency contact including A/B/C plans.
- Pack microspikes and shoulder-season layers by default.
- Pre-rig guyline knots and test headlamp batteries.
- Book hut or campsite permits if required.

### Daily Field Routine
- Morning: weather check, calorie preload, warm-up walk before heavy ascent.
- Midday: electrolyte dose, adjust layers, reconfirm turnaround time.
- Evening: dry socks, tent ventilation, check fuel levels, journal route notes for next day.

## Training and Conditioning
- **Uphill tolerance**: Weekly stair or hill sessions with loaded pack (15–25 lb) to mimic steep grades.
- **Technical footing**: Practice on wet rocks or gym balance tools to improve proprioception.
- **Cold and wind acclimation**: Controlled exposure hikes with deliberate layer testing.
- **Endurance**: Back-to-back day hikes to simulate cumulative fatigue of a three-day push.

## Sample Daily Time Plan
| Time | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 05:30 | Wake, hot drink, light breakfast |
| 06:30 | Break camp, begin ascent |
| 09:30 | Ridge entry; assess wind and visibility |
| 11:30 | Midpoint check; confirm A/B/C route selection |
| 14:30 | Descent; water refill before dry stretch |
| 17:30 | Camp setup, dinner, weather review |

## Debrief Framework
- Review split times versus plan; note where terrain slowed progress.
- Evaluate layer performance: which items stayed in the pack, which were overused.
- Update wind and exposure thresholds based on lived experience.
- Capture hut/tent site notes: water reliability, crowding patterns, and noise exposure.
- Translate lessons into revised checklists for future trips.

## Conclusion
A well-run three-day White Mountains trip blends ambition with disciplined fallback options. Use this playbook to standardize your planning, rehearse decisions before you need them, and lead teams with confidence. Treat every outing as a chance to refine navigation habits, shelter deployment, and weather-driven timing so the next ridge day feels both rewarding and predictable.

## Campsite Strategy and Permits
Selecting compliant, low-impact campsites in the White Mountains requires understanding backcountry regulations and adapting to seasonal constraints.

- **Designated sites**: Many high-use corridors funnel campers to established platforms. Arrive early to secure space and be prepared with extra cordage to anchor on wood. Carry a small broom to clear debris, then inspect for nails or splinters.
- **200-foot rule**: In areas without platforms, camp at least 200 feet from trails and water. Use pre-existing durable surfaces and avoid mossy or sensitive alpine vegetation.
- **Bear protocols**: While bear incidents are less frequent than in some regions, food-conditioned animals do exist. Use canisters where required, hang food properly elsewhere, and keep scented items consolidated.
- **Water access**: In drought years, low streams can turn into trickles. Carry a 1–2L collapsible bucket to haul water to camp and prevent site erosion.
- **Winter camping**: Frozen ground improves tent staking if you pre-pack snow anchors. Avoid camping in drainages that can collect overnight freeze-thaw meltwater.

## Weather Workflow Example
This workflow outlines a simple decision ladder for a three-day weekend when an unsettled forecast threatens summits:

1. **48 hours out**: Pull point forecasts for each ridge segment, comparing wind speeds and precip types. Prepare alternate routes staying below treeline if winds exceed 40 mph.
2. **24 hours out**: Confirm road access and parking. Review avalanche statements if near slide paths. Update satellite messenger preset message with final plan.
3. **Night before**: Pack layers for wet and cold scenarios, emphasizing vapor barriers for boots and gloves if freezing rain is possible.
4. **Morning of Day 1**: Assess cloud ceiling and visibility. If early storms appear, delay ridge plans and focus on sheltered approach hike.
5. **Evening Day 1**: Re-run forecast with camped elevation in mind. If winds are trending upward, adjust Day 2 objective to a lower ridge or forested traverse.
6. **Morning Day 2**: Set strict turnaround times. If forecasts diverge, choose the more conservative interpretation and brief the team.
7. **Day 3**: Prioritize early exit before weather deteriorates; maintain dry layers for vehicle departure to prevent chill while driving.

## Leadership and Group Management
- **Briefing discipline**: Begin each day with a five-minute safety brief covering route, hazards, and signals. End with a concise debrief to capture fatigue levels.
- **Pacing**: Use the slowest comfortable pace; avoid yo-yoing speeds that exhaust the group. Implement 50-minute on/10-minute off cycles for heavy climbs.
- **Morale tools**: Warm beverages, music on low volume at camp, and pre-planned scenic stops maintain group cohesion. Recognize early signs of energy debt.
- **Conflict prevention**: Clarify decision authority before departure. Encourage quiet time on steep ascents and regroup at obvious landmarks to reduce miscommunication.
- **Teaching moments**: Rotate map and compass tasks, route calls, and stove setup to build shared competence across the team.
